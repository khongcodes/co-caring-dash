This is the front end repository for the [Co-Caring dashboard project](https://devpost.com/software/co-caring-dashboard-working-together-to-suppress-covid-19) for the [Hack COVID-19 Pandemic Response Hackathon](https://hackcovid19.devpost.com/).

This dashboard is meant to provide data to support local and community actions like shelter-in-place (and other non-pharmaceutical interventions), and spread Vytality Healthâ€™s #Co-Caring movement, which seeks to spur individuals to reach out and take care of their neighbors as the COVID-19 pandemic around us continues.
